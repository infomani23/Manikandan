    <h3>Author: James Clear</h3>
    <p>
      World-renowned habits expert James Clear has discovered a simpler system
      for transforming your life. He knows that lasting change comes from the
      compound effect of hundreds of small decisions - doing two push-ups a day,
      waking up five minutes early, or holding a single short phone call. He
      calls them atomic habits.
